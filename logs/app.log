Because the island is only connected to the mainland by a long, thin, heavily-guarded path that seems like it might disappear when the tide comes in, people like Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) are able to build semi-stable lives for themselves. </p>\n<p id="ojiiWt">But things are very different and dangerous on the mainland where time has given rise to all sorts of new mutations in the infected. Though the trailer doesn’t really give you a sense of why Jamie wants to journey into infected territory, it makes it clear that he’ll encounter other people who have somehow managed to survive living among the rabid pseudo-undead. Between the <em>Purge</em>-like masks and towers of skulls on display in the trailer, the mainland human survivors almost seem more ghoulish than the infected they live in fear of.

Their findings were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y">published in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>\n<p id="vUkmo6">“This historic accomplishment is known in the field as ‘below threshold’ — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits,” Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes on Google’s blog. “You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493">quantum error correction</a> was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.”</p>\n<div id="dHgwUo">\n<blockquote align="center" class="twitter-tweet">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Introducing Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip with a breakthrough that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits, cracking a 30-year challenge in the field.

Going forward, Neven says quantum technology will be “indispensable” for collecting AI training data, eventually helping to “discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives.”</p>', 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317382/google-willow-quantum-computing-chip-breakthrough'}], 'link': 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317382/google-willow-quantum-computing-chip-breakthrough', 'id': 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317382/google-willow-quantum-computing-chip-breakthrough', 'guidislink': False, 'authors': [{'name': 'Emma Roth'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Emma Roth'}, 'author': 'Emma Roth'}, {'published': '2024-12-09T17:29:18-05:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=22, tm_min=29, tm_sec=18, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=344, tm_isdst=0), 'updated': '2024-12-09T17:29:18-05:00', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=9, tm_hour=22, tm_min=29, tm_sec=18, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=344, tm_isdst=0), 'title': 'Spotify shuts down Car Thing, and now owners have one last chance at a refund', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': '', 'value': 'Spotify shuts down Car Thing, and now owners have one last chance at a refund'}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': '', 'value': '<figure>\n      <img alt="car thing device mounted to a car vent" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0AohiSbsgfavvcQxXoO60ZzDVkc=/235x28:1938x1163/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73776966/acarman_20210412_4524_0003.0.jpg" />\n        <figcaption>Photo by Ashley Carman / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id="ImhDP4">Spotify has officially shut down its Car Thing accessory that offered simple and slick control over music and playlists while driving, and it’s giving owners just over a month (January 14th) to reach out to the company and get a refund.

Tesla has no independent dealerships, but dealership associations in multiple states have filed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/tesla-gets-us-assist-lawsuit-challenging-louisiana-direct-sales-ban-2023-10-20/\">numerous lawsuits</a> against Tesla to prevent the company from selling cars. </p>\n<p id=\"NCzcRH\">Amazon\u2019s deal with Hyundai neatly sidesteps this issue by ensuring that dealers remain a crucial part of the process. Most dealers allow customers to browse and buy a car through their own websites, but having Amazon as an additional platform with millions of daily customers is sure to help make the process even easier.</p>", "links": [{"rel": "alternate", "type": "text/html", "href": "https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317821/amazon-autos-hyundai-online-car-shopping"}], "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317821/amazon-autos-hyundai-online-car-shopping", "id": "https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317821/amazon-autos-hyundai-online-car-shopping", "guidislink": false, "authors": [{"name": "Andrew J.

Although the Moonlink cables are available as part of a bundle with the Moonbase power strip, you only get one of each of the four versions —  unfortunately, you can’t pick and choose which of the cables will work best for your setup.</p>', 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317792/genki-moonbase-moonlink-usb-c-power-charger-cables'}], 'link': 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317792/genki-moonbase-moonlink-usb-c-power-charger-cables', 'id': 'https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24317792/genki-moonbase-moonlink-usb-c-power-charger-cables', 'guidislink': False, 'authors': [{'name': 'Andrew Liszewski'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Andrew Liszewski'}, 'author': 'Andrew Liszewski'}, {'published': '2024-12-10T09:32:31-05:00', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=10, tm_hour=14, tm_min=32, tm_sec=31, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=345, tm_isdst=0), 'updated': '2024-12-10T09:32:31-05:00', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2024, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=10, tm_hour=14, tm_min=32, tm_sec=31, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=345, tm_isdst=0), 'title': 'Solos challenges Meta’s Ray-Bans with $299 ChatGPT smart glasses', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': '', 'value': 'Solos challenges Meta’s Ray-Bans with $299 ChatGPT smart glasses'}, 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': '', 'value': '<figure>\n      <img alt="The Solos AirGo Vision smart glasses in the krypton 1 frame style." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3zCm7bc-loXzewOTl25ad4e0Yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73778005/Solo_AirGo_Vision_grey.0.jpg" />\n        <figcaption>Image: Solos</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id="lTT8tD">Solos’ camera-equipped smart glasses have arrived to provide some much-needed competition against Meta’s Ray-Bans.
